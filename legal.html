				WEBSITE ACCURACY<br>

				We endeavour to ensure that the details of all products, including prices, displayed on our websites are accurate. However, given the high volume of flights, hotels and other products offered it is inevitable that, in exceptional cases, mistakes will arise.  We cannot accept liability for these errors.<br>

				Where inaccuracies relate to the understatement of the price of a specific product you will be offered either a full refund of money paid on that booking only or the opportunity to maintain that booking on receipt of the additional payment which is necessary.<br>

				Whilst we have taken every due care and diligence with the production of our website and price list, there may however be occasions beyond our control where certain fares are withdrawn by the airline. We will not be held responsible if for any reason these fares are withdrawn. No compensation is payable in the event of withdrawal of any fares. Air fares are not guaranteed until tickets are confirmed and purchased. All fares are subject to confirmation and change prior to ticket issue.<br>
